🐍 Mini Python Projects

A collection of beginner-friendly Python programs created while learning the language.
Each mini-project focuses on building logic and understanding core programming concepts in a fun and simple way.

📘 Project List
🧮 Day 1 — Simple Calculator

A basic calculator that:

Takes two numbers and an operator as input (+, -, *, /)

Performs the operation and displays the result

Handles invalid inputs and division by zero

Concepts used: Variables, input/output, conditionals, error handling

🏝️ Treasure Island (Tkinter GUI Game)

Note: This project is inspired by a similar game. I created a text-based version without Tkinter as well.

A fun GUI-based adventure game using Tkinter

Click-based choices to navigate and find the treasure

Wrong decisions end the game with entertaining messages

Concepts used: Tkinter GUI, functions, event handling, message boxes

🔐 Day 2 — Password Strength Checker

Simple program that:

Checks the length of a password

Tells whether the password is Strong or Weak

Concepts used: Strings, conditionals, input validation

🎯 Day 3 — Number Guessing Game

A random number guessing game where:

The computer selects a random number

Player guesses within limited attempts

Includes Easy, Medium, and Hard modes

Gives hints and stores best/worst attempt counts

Concepts used: Loops, functions, random module, conditionals

🏦 Day 4 — Simple ATM Simulator

A command-line ATM program that allows users to:

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Check account balance

Also handles insufficient balance and invalid inputs.

Concepts used: Loops, conditionals, functions, variables

✅ Day 5 — To-Do List Program

A simple task management program where users can:

➕ Add new tasks

🗑️ Remove existing tasks

📋 View all tasks

🚪 Exit the program

Concepts used: Lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, error handling

🔤 Day 6 — Hangman Game

A classic word-guessing game where the player must guess a hidden word letter by letter before running out of lives.

The game randomly selects a word from a word list

Correct guesses reveal letters in the word

Wrong guesses reduce the player's 6 lives

ASCII Hangman graphics update after each incorrect guess

Prevents duplicate guesses and ends with WIN or LOSE message

Concepts used: Loops, lists, strings, random module, conditionals, user input handling

📇 Day 7 — Contact Information Lookup

A simple Python program that stores personal information (name, phone number, and email) for multiple people and allows the user to retrieve details by entering a name.

Prompts the user to enter a person’s name

Displays the stored contact information if the name exists

Shows an error message if the name is not found

Uses functions to organize and return information for each person

Concepts used: Dictionaries, functions, user input, conditionals, data retrieval
