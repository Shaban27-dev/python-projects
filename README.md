🐍 Mini Python Projects

This repository contains a set of small Python programs I’ve built while learning the language.
Each mini-project focuses on a basic programming concept — from simple input/output to Number guessing game.

📘 Project List
🧮 Day 1 — Simple Calculator

A basic calculator that:

* Takes two numbers and an operator as input (+, -, *, /)

* Performs the calculation and prints the result

* Includes error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero

Concepts used: Conditional statements, user input, type casting


🏝️ Treasure Island (Tkinter GUI Game). This game is not made by me, although i 've made a game similar to this but without tkinter.

* A fun text-based adventure game built using Tkinter (GUI library).

* Navigate through choices to find the treasure

* Wrong choices end the game with fun messages

* Demonstrates the use of buttons, labels, and message boxes

Concepts used: GUI programming with Tkinter, functions, event handling


🔐 Day 2 — Password Strength Checker

* A simple password checker that:

* Evaluates password strength based on its length

* Prints whether the password is strong or weak

Concepts used: Strings, conditionals, input validation


🎯 Day 3 — Number Guessing Game

A random number guessing game where:

* The computer picks a random number

* The player tries to guess within limited attempts

* Includes Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty modes

* Provides hints and keeps track of best and worst scores

Concepts used: Loops, random module, conditional logic, functions.


🏦 Day 4 — Simple ATM Simulator

A command-line ATM simulation program that:

Allows users to Deposit, Withdraw, and Check Balance

Handles insufficient balance and invalid input cases gracefully

Mimics real ATM operations in a simple, text-based format

Concepts used: Loops, conditionals, variables, user-defined functions
